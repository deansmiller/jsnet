<h2>Character Recognition in JavaScript using a Neural Network</h2>

<p>What do you when work is slow or so easy you can do it alongside your own stuff? Recreate your third year uni project in JavaScript, that's what!</p>

<p>Just a little experiment I have been hacking together. I have had an interest in Machine Learning techniques since uni and maybe I will build some other toy apps</p>

<p>Give it a try @ jsnet.nodejitsu.com</p>
