<h2>Character Recognition in JavaScript using a Neural Network</h2>

<p>What do you when work is slow or so easy you can do it alongside your own stuff? Recreate your third year uni project in JavaScript, that's what!</p>

<p>Just a little experiment I have been hacking together. After being trained it recognises 1, 2 and 3 pretty well considering the tiny, tiny data set. I have had an interest in Machine Learning techniques since uni and maybe I will build some other toy apps</p>

<p>This provided an ample opportunity to play with Web Workers because the training of the network can be intensive on the browsers resources. Using a Web Worker I was able to keep the UI responsive. I also used g.raphael for the chart (https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/g.raphael)</p>

<p>Give it a try @ jsnet.nodejitsu.com</p>

<p>Note: Does not work in FF at the moment. In no way is this a completed, tried and tested app</p>
