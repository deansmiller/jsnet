<h2>Character Recognition in JavaScript using a Neural Network</h2>

<p>What do you when work is slow or so easy you can do it alongside your own stuff? Recreate your third year uni project in JavaScript, that's what!</p>

<p>Just a little experiment I have been hacking together. After being trained it recognises 1, 2 and 3 pretty well considering the tiny, tiny data set. I have had an interest in Machine Learning techniques since uni and maybe I will build some other toy apps</p>

<p>Give it a try @ jsnet.nodejitsu.com</p>

<p>Note: Does not work in FF at the moment. In no way is this a completed, tried and tested app</p>
